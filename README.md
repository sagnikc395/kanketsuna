a smol web framework for being productive and building things at
the speed of light

### background

i was listening to Lex's podcast with DHH, and while i don't agree with a lot
of stuff that DHH claims, I agree with his thinking of building stuff that can deploy changes and be helpful for us faster should be be the default
for the "AI age.

we need a framework that is easy , fast and quick to deploy .

### what is this about ?

this is a collection of tools , hodgepodged together to build a fast and uniform developer
experience to build and deploy ML/AI applications faster.


### Inspiration :
