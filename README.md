a smol web framework for being productive and building things at
the speed of light

### background

i was listening to Lex's podcast with DHH, and while i don't agree with a lot
of stuff that DHH claims, I think that building stuff that can deploy changes and
stuff can be made easier and faster.

for the "AI age", we need a framework that can deploy faster and make stuff faster.

### what is this about ?

this is a collection of tools , hodgepodge together to build a fast and uniform developer
experience to build and deploy ML/AI applications faster.
